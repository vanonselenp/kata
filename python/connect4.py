# ## Description

# This game is played on a vertical board wich has seven hollow columns and six rows.
# Each column has a hole in the upper part of the board, where pieces are introduced.
# There is a window for every square, so that pieces can be seen from both sides.
# In short, itÂ´s a vertical board with 42 windows distributed in 6 rows and 7 columns.
# Both players have a set of 21 thin pieces (like coins); each of them uses a different
# colour. The board is empty at the start of the game.

# ## Objective

# The aim for both players is to make a straight line of four own pieces; the line can
# be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.

# ## How the game goes on

# Before starting, players decide randomly which of them will be the beginner;
# * moves are made alternatively, one by turn.
# * Moves entails in placing new pieces on the board; pieces slide downwards from upper
# holes, falling down to the last row or piling up on the last piece introduced in
# the same column. So, in every turn the introduced piece may be placed at most on
# seven different squares.
# The winner is the first player who gets a straight line made with four own pieces
# and no gaps between them.
